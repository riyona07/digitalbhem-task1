**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT** 

The Student Grade Calculator is a simple console-based application designed to help students calculate their grades based on the marks obtained in various subjects. The program prompts the user to input the number of subjects and the corresponding marks for each subject. It then computes the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the calculated percentage. This tool can be useful for students to quickly assess their academic performance.

**OBJECTIVES**

User Input: To allow users to input the number of subjects and their respective marks. 
Calculation of Total Marks: To compute the total marks obtained by the student across all subjects. 
Percentage Calculation: To calculate the average percentage based on the total marks and the maximum possible marks. 
Grade Assignment: To determine the grade based on the calculated percentage using predefined criteria. 
User -Friendly Output: To display the results in a clear and understandable format.

**KEY FEATURES**

Dynamic Subject Input: Users can specify the number of subjects, making the application flexible for different academic scenarios. 
Marks Entry: The program allows users to enter marks for each subject individually. 
Total Marks Calculation: Automatically calculates the total marks obtained by the student. 
Percentage Calculation: Computes the average percentage based on the total marks. 
Grade Calculation: Assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the percentage using a simple grading scale. 
Console-Based Interface: Simple and straightforward user interface that runs in the console.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

Java: The primary programming language used to develop the application. Java is chosen for its portability, ease of use, and strong support for object-oriented programming.
Java Standard Library: Utilizes the java.util.Scanner class for handling user input from the console. 
Basic Control Structures: Uses loops and conditional statements to manage user input and perform calculations.

This project serves as a practical example of basic programming concepts in Java, including user input handling, arithmetic operations, and conditional logic. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as data validation, a graphical user interface (GUI), or the ability to save results to a file.# digitalbhem-task1
